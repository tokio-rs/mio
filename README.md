# Mio â€“ Metal I/O

Mio is a fast, low-level I/O library for Rust focusing on non-blocking APIs and
event notification for building high performance I/O apps with as little
overhead as possible over the OS abstractions.

**API documentation**

* [v0.8](https://docs.rs/mio/^0.8)
* [v0.7](https://docs.rs/mio/^0.7)

This is a low level library, if you are looking for something easier to get
started with, see [Tokio](https://tokio.rs).

## Usage

To use `mio`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mio = "0.8"
```

Next we can start using Mio. The following is quick introduction using
`TcpListener` and `TcpStream`. Note that `features = ["os-poll", "net"]` must be
specified for this example.

```rust
use std::error::Error;

use mio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use mio::{Events, Interest, Poll, Token};

// Some tokens to allow us to identify which event is for which socket.
const SERVER: Token = Token(0);
const CLIENT: Token = Token(1);

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Create a poll instance.
    let mut poll = Poll::new()?;
    // Create storage for events.
    let mut events = Events::with_capacity(128);

    // Setup the server socket.
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:13265".parse()?;
    let mut server = TcpListener::bind(addr)?;
    // Start listening for incoming connections.
    poll.registry()
        .register(&mut server, SERVER, Interest::READABLE)?;

    // Setup the client socket.
    let mut client = TcpStream::connect(addr)?;
    // Register the socket.
    poll.registry()
        .register(&mut client, CLIENT, Interest::READABLE | Interest::WRITABLE)?;

    // Start an event loop.
    loop {
        // Poll Mio for events, blocking until we get an event.
        poll.poll(&mut events, None)?;

        // Process each event.
        for event in events.iter() {
            // We can use the token we previously provided to `register` to
            // determine for which socket the event is.
            match event.token() {
                SERVER => {
                    // If this is an event for the server, it means a connection
                    // is ready to be accepted.
                    //
                    // Accept the connection and drop it immediately. This will
                    // close the socket and notify the client of the EOF.
                    let connection = server.accept();
                    drop(connection);
                }
                CLIENT => {
                    if event.is_writable() {
                        // We can (likely) write to the socket without blocking.
                    }

                    if event.is_readable() {
                        // We can (likely) read from the socket without blocking.
                    }

                    // Since the server just shuts down the connection, let's
                    // just exit from our event loop.
                    return Ok(());
                }
                // We don't expect any events with tokens other than those we provided.
                _ => unreachable!(),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Features

* Non-blocking TCP, UDP
* I/O event queue backed by epoll, kqueue, and IOCP
* Zero allocations at runtime
* Platform specific extensions

## Non-goals

The following are specifically omitted from Mio and are left to the user
or higher-level libraries.

* File operations
* Thread pools / multi-threaded event loop
* Timers

## Platforms

Currently supported platforms:

* Android (API level 21)
* DragonFly BSD
* FreeBSD
* Linux
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD
* Windows
* iOS
* macOS

There are potentially others. If you find that Mio works on another
platform, submit a PR to update the list!

Mio can handle interfacing with each of the event systems of the aforementioned
platforms. The details of their implementation are further discussed in the
`Poll` type of the API documentation (see above).

The Windows implementation for polling sockets is using the [wepoll] strategy.
This uses the Windows AFD system to access socket readiness events.
